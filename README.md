🔐 Project 2B — MFA Roll-out & Lockout Recovery Workshop

 Overview
This project demonstrates a simulated **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** rollout, lockout, and user recovery process in a demo identity environment using **Azure AD trial / Google Identity** and **Authenticator apps**.

The goal was to strengthen organizational security posture while ensuring smooth user recovery paths and proper communication protocols.
